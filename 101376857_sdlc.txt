Software development is an iterative process that is followed for a software project that consists of several phases for building and running software applications. SDLC helps with the measurement and improvement of a process, which allows an analysis of software development each step of the way.
SDLC simply outlines each task that is required to create and deploy a software applicationâ€”this prevents the reduction of waste and increases efficiency along the way. Monitoring that is a part of SDLC helps companies ensure that everything is timely, budgets are adhered to, and the software continues to be a feasible investment. SDLC is often described as leveraging Agile or Waterfall approaches and many organizations use a hybrid of both.
