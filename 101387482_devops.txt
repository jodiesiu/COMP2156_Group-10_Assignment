With DevOps, an organization can deliver applications and services at high velocity by combining cultural philosophies, practices, and tools. Organizations with traditional software development and infrastructure management processes can evolve and improve
products at a faster pace than those using DevOps. The faster the organization can serve the customer and compete in the market, the better it is able to serve its customers.
DevOps eliminates the notion that development and operations teams are separate and â€œsiloed". It is not uncommon for these two teams to be merged into one where engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and testing to deploymentand operations, and develop a range of skills. In every aspect of life, from shopping to entertainment to banking, software and the Internet have revolutionized the world and its industries. A business cannot function without software; 
it is an integral part of all parts of the business. In many cases, companies provide their customers with online services or applications delivered through various types of devices.
