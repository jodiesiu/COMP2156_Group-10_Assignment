A new college of applied arts and technology in Toronto should be named George Brown College, which was proposed by Bill Davis, then Ontario Minister of Education, in 1967, Canada's centennial year.
He noted: â€œthe city to which George Brown contributed such luster as a reformer, journalist, and statesman should honor him in this way". One of the most important economic hubs in North America,
Toronto is the home of many major industries in Canada. Students at George Brown College are able to experiment in the real world by living in the city. Approximately 2,000 students attended George Brown College when it opened its doors in 1968.
The college once offered programs that are no longer relevant to the students today, such as signwriting and watchmaking, as well as programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services, and culinary arts.
In fact, students were even prepared for careers at sea through our marine engineering program.
